## How it works
   * Right now all data lives in state. Changes are made and rendered from the state level. Data is organized for D3 to render into a visual format.
## Future plans
    * With more time, I would like to implement MongoDB stitch to set up a serverless connection to my database. I plann to use their React-Native SDK and Atlas cloud platform to make it a full stack application
